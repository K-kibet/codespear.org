 The world is expanding digitally and with every aspect of our lives becoming digital, the demand for computer experts is skyrocketing each day. Therefore, having knowledge of programming languages has become crucial for every IT professional. In fact, programming languages sit at the epicentre of this ever-growing field of Computer Science.

If you are a beginner in programming, learning a new language or a new framework is essential. As a fresher in the field of programming language, make sure that you remain steady in both learning and coding. However, it can be daunting and confusing for you to choose the best one out of a pool of hundreds of programming languages out there.
</p>
<p>
Here are the top 7 programming languages that you can hang in 2021 and learn them to improve your coding skills:
 </p>

Not only this, with the use of JavaScript, one can also build full-scale games in an external game engine or the browser using JavaScript. JavaScript is mainly used for Front-end and back-end web development, mobile apps and developing games
    </p>
<p>
<div id='python'>2. Python</div>
The ever-growing importance of data in business has resulted in a quick rise in popularity and demand for Python. Python is used in server-side development, web and mobile app development to building machine learning software, there's nothing Python can't do. Also, this programming language has a vast collection of libraries, tools, and frameworks that make it a must in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.
  </p>
<p>
Along with being exceptional at handling Data, it’s also incredibly versatile. Therefore, based on potential and demand, Python is one language to learn in 2021 and it’s intuitive and elementary to learn, even for beginners. Python is mainly used for data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, back end development, web/ mobile app development and Internet of Things.

C# is commonly known as “C sharp”. This was built by Microsoft and inspired by the C programming language. However, C# is way more advanced than the C programming language. Also, it is dynamic and fully integrated with the .NET framework. C# is loved by most developers as it is used for making 2D and 3D games using the Unity gaming engine. Not only this, it is prevalent for desktop and mobile app development, too. C# holds 4th position in the PYPL popularity index at this moment, the demand and growth of C# as a programming language is certainly going to scale with time.
    </p>
<p>
So, if you are a beginner and planning to learn a programming language, try hands-on with C# in 2021. C# is mainly used for 2D and 3D game development, web development, desktop and mobile apps VR. Well, gaining knowledge of multiple programming languages has also become a trend among techies in recent years. Also, it is important to brush up on your programming knowledge every now and then by taking skill tests and by participating in challenges and hackathons. If you are a programming enthusiast, TechGig can be your one-stop platform to fulfil all your learning and upskilling needs.
