      <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
      <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.</p>
      <p>There are four platforms of the Java programming language:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java Platform
        </li>
        <li>Standard Edition (Java SE) Java Platform</li>
        <li>Enterprise Edition (Java EE) Java Platform</li>
        <li>Micro Edition (Java ME)</li>
      </ul>

        JavaScript
      </header>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming
        conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
        instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
        Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      <p>Code for JavaScript</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");</code>
      <p>Code for Java</p>
      <code> public static void main(String args[]){ System. out. println("Hello Java");</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Scope</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
      </ul>

        Variables
      </header>
      <p>Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. Variable is a memory location name of the data.</p>
      
      <code>String, int, float, boolean</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id='Scope'>
      <header>
        Scope
      </header>
      <p>In Java, scope defines where a certain variable or method is accessible in a program. Variables can be defined as having one of three types of scope: 1) Class level scope (instance variables): any variable declared within a class is accessible by all methods in that class.</p><p>In Java, there are three types of variables based on their scope:
      <ul>
<li>Member Variables (Class Level Scope)</li>
        <li>Local Variables (Method Level Scope)</li>
        </ul></p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id='Functions'>
      <header>
        Functions
      </header>
      <p>In Java, all function definitions must be inside classes. We also call functions methods. Let's look at an example:
        <code>method public class Main { public static void foo() { // Do something here } }</code>
        <p>foo is a method we defined in class Main.</p>
