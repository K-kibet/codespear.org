                    Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by
                    Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of
                    platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
                    This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java.
                    This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while
                    learning Java Programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software
                    Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list
                    down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Object Oriented</b> − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily
                        extended since it is based on the Object model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Platform Independent</b> − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++,
                        when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into
                        platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted
                        by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Simple</b> − Java is designed to be easy to learn.
                        If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Secure</b> − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems.
                        Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Architecture-neutral</b> − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format,
                        which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Portable</b> − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects
                        of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with
                        a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Robust</b> − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing
                        mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentallydifferent in some others.
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                    supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                    Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance;
                    that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions
                    without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing
                    as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected,
                    and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
                    explicitly typed.

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                    The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
                    This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what
                    can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables,
                    you can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two data types available in Java −

                <p>Local variables</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Local variables are created when the method, constructor or block is entered
                        and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the method, constructor, or block.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Instance variables</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use
                        of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Class/Static variables</p>

                    <li>
                        Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static
                        keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.

                    <li>
                        Visibility is similar to instance variables. However, most static variables are
                        declared public since they must be available for users of the class.

        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    If you have experience with other programming languages, such as C and C++, you have probably used global
                    variables. A global variable is one that is accessible to all parts of a program and is usually declared
                    as part of the first lines of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java doesn't technically support global variables. As a pure object-oriented language, everything needs to
                    be part of a class. The reason is to protect data and members of classes from being changed, inadvertently
                    or on purpose, by other parts of the program. However, you still may need to have variables that can be accessed
                    across your program, and not confined to specific classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's take a look at some ways to achieve this, starting with static variables.
                    This code shows how we declare two variables within a class. Although we're declaring price and pages
                    in the Openclass class, they are static variables and can now be used by instances of Openclass.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        public class Openclass
                        {
                            public static double price = 15.24;
                            public static long pages = 1053;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A constant is a variable whose value cannot change once it
                    has been assigned. Java doesn't have built-in support for constants.
                    A constant can make our program more easily read and understood by others. In addition, a constant
                    is cached by the JVM as well as our application, so using a constant can improve performance. To define
                    a variable as a constant, we just need to add the keyword “final” in front of the variable declaration.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        final float pi = 3.14f;
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The above statement declares the float variable “pi” as a constant with a value of 3.14f. We cannot change the value
                    of "pi" at any point in time in the program. Later if we try to do that by using a statement like “pi=5.25f”,
                    Java will throw errors at compile time itself. It is not mandatory that we need to assign values of constants during
                    initialization itself.

                <p>
                    There are eight primitive datatypes and objects supported by Java.
                    Primitive datatypes are predefined by the language and named by a keyword.
                    Objects have a state and a behavior. An object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. 
                    Let us now look into the eight primitive data types and object in detail:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        int

                    Use the <code>if</code> statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is <code>true</code>.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>

                        {
                            // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
                        }
                        else if (condition2)

                            // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
                        }

                    There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.
                    It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple
                    if else statements:

                <p>
                    There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several
                    number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first
                    statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
                    Java programming language provides the while loop which repeats a statement or
                    group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition
                    before executing the loop body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>while</code> loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is <code>true</code>:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        while (condition)
                        {
                            // code block to be executed
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The <code>do/while</code> loop is a variant of the <code>while</code> loop. This loop will execute the code
                    block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop
                    as long as the condition is true.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        do
                        {
                            // code block to be executed
                        }
                        while (condition);
                    </pre>

                <p>
                    A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation.
                    When you call the System.out.println() method, for example, the system actually executes several
                    statements in order to display a message on the console.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering the following example to explain the syntax of a method:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        public static int methodName(int a, int b)
                        {
                            // body
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Above,
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>public static </b>- modifier</li>
                        <li><b>int </b>- return type</li>
                        <li><b>methodName </b>- name of the method</li>
                        <li><b>a, b </b>- formal parameters</li>
                        <li><b>int a, int b</b>- list of parameters</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The following code is used to simplify the method syntax: </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        modifier returnType nameOfMethod (Parameter List)
                        {
                            // method body
                        }
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The syntax shown above includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>modifier </b>- It defines the access type of the method and it is optional to use.</li>
                        <li><b>returnType </b>- Method may return a value.</li>
                        <li><b>nameOfMethod  </b>- This is the method name. The method signature consists of the methodname and the parameter list.</li>
                        <li><b>Parameter List </b>- The list of parameters, it is the type, order, and number of parameters of a method. These are optional, method may contain zero parameters.</li>
                        <li><b>method body </b>- The method body defines what the method does with the statements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
