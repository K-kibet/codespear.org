          <p>
            Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, 
            object-oriented and secure programming language. Java was developed by Sun 
            Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James 
            Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since 
            Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed 
            the Oak name to Java.<br>
            <b>Platform:</b> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, 
            is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and an API, 
            it is called a platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java 
            programming:-<br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Standalone Application:</b>
              Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based 
              applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every 
              machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. 
              AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.</li>
              <li><b>Web Application:</b>
              An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is 
              called a web application. Technologies like Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, 
              Hibernate, JSF, etc. are used for creating web applications in Java.</li>
              <li><b>Enterprise Application:</b>
              An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, 
              etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level 
              security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating 
              enterprise applications.</li>
              <li><b>Mobile Application</b>
              An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile 
              application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile 
              applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 4 major platforms or editions of Java:-
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Java SE (Java Standard Edition):</b>
              It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as 
              java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes 
              core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, 
              I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):</b>
              It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web an enterprise 
              application. It is built on the top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics 
              like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Java ME (Java Micro Edition):</b>
              It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.</li>
              <li><b>JavaFX:</b>
              It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user 
              interface API.</li>
            </ul>

        <header>Features of Java</header>
          <article>
            <p>The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it 
            portable, simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are 
            also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of 
            this language. The features of Java are also known as java buzzwords.</p>
            <p>
            <b>A list of most important features of the Java language is given below:-</b>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple</li>
              <li>Object-Oriented</li>

          <header>Hello World in Java</header>
          <article>
            Here, we will learn how to write the simple program of Java. We can 
            write a simple hello java program easily after installing the JDK.<br>
            To create a simple java program, you need to create a class that contains the 
            main method.
            <code>
            class Simple{  
              public static void main(String args[]){  
                System.out.println("Hello World");  
               }  
              }  
            </code>
            <br><b>Compilation Flow:-</b><br>
            When we compile Java program, the Java compiler converts the source code into 
            byte code.

          <header>Variables in Java</header>
          <p>
            A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is 
            executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of a
            memory location.<br><br>
            <b>These are the types of variables in Java:-</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Local variables</li>
              <li>Instance variables</li>
              <li>Static variables</li>
            </ul>
            <b>There are the types of data types in Java:-</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Primitive data types</li>
              <li>Non-Primitive data types</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Example of declaring variables in Java:-</b>
            <code>
                class A{  
                  int data=50;   //instance variable  
                  static int m=100;    //static variable  
                  void method()
                  {  
                    int n=90;    //local variable  
                  }

          <header>Loops in Java</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              In programming languages, loops are used to execute a set of instructions or 
              functions repeatedly when some conditions become true.<br><br>
              <b>There are three basic types of loops in Java:-</b><br><br>
              <b>for loop</b><br>
              The Java for loop is a control flow statement that iterates a part of the 
              programs multiple times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended 
              to use for loop.<br>
              <b>Example of for loop in Java:-</b>
              <code>
                for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
                {  
                    System.out.println(i);  
                }  
              </code><br>
              <b>while loop</b><br>
              The Java while loop is a control flow statement that executes a part of the 
              programs repeatedly on the basis of given boolean condition. If the number 
              of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.<br>
              <b>Example of while loop in Java:-</b>
              <code>
                int i=1;  
                while(i<=10)
                {  
                System.out.println(i);  
                i++;  
                }  
              </code><br>
              <b>do-white loop</b><br>
              The Java do while loop is a control flow statement that executes a part of 
              the programs at least once and the further execution depends upon the given 
              boolean condition. If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have 
              to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use the do-while loop.
              <br>
              <b>Example of do-while loop in Java:-</b>
              <code>
              int i=1;  
              do
              {  
                System.out.println(i);  
                i++;  
              }while(i<=10); 
              </code><br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
              frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
              name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
              document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
              parent.phoneNumber.

            <p>
             OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a methodology or paradigm 
             to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software 
             development and maintenance by providing some concepts:-<br>
             <ul>
              <li>Objects</li>
              <li>Classes</li>
              <li>Inheritance</li>
              <li>Polymorphism</li>
              <li>Abstraction</li>
              <li>Encapsulation</li>
             </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in 
            Object-Oriented design:-<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Coupling</li>
              <li>Cohesion</li>
