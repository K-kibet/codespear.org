      <article>
        <p>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).</p>
        <p>The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 10. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. </p>
        <p>Java is -
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Object Oriented − </strong> In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independent − </strong> Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed
              over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure −</strong> With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</li>
            <li><strong>Architecture-neutral −</strong>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</li>
            <li><strong>Multithreaded −</strong> With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed −</strong>Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.</li>
          </ul>

    <section class='main-section' id='Identifiers'>
      <header>Identifiers</header>
      <article>
        <p>All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called <strong>identifiers.</strong></p>
        <p>In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows −
          <ul>
            <li>All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).</li>
            <li>After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.</li>
            <li>A key word cannot be used as an identifier.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.</li>
            <li>Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.</li>
            <li>Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

    <section class='main-section' id='Modifiers'>
      <header>Modifiers</header>
      <article>
        <p>Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes, methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers −
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Access Modifiers −</strong>default, public , protected, private</li>
            <li><strong>Non-access Modifiers −</strong> final, abstract, strictfp</li>
          </ul>

    <section class='main-section' id='Objects_in_Java'>
      <header>Objects in Java</header>
      <article>
        <p>Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='Classes_in_Java'>
      <header>Classes in Java</header>
      <article>
        <p>A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.</p>
        <p>A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the above example, barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are methods.</p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong>
          <code>
       public class Dog {
           String breed;
           int age;
           String color;

         void barking() {
         }

         void hungry() {
         }

         void sleeping() {
         }
    }
       </code>

    <section class='main-section' id='Java_Constructor'>
      <header>Java Constructor</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.
          <p>
            <p>
              Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.</p>
            <p>
              All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer
              used.
            </p>
            <p>Following is the syntax of a constructor −</p>
            <code>
         class ClassName {
           ClassName() {
           }
         }
      </code>
            <p>Java allows two types of constructors namely −
              <ul>
                <li>No argument Constructors</li>
                <li>Parameterized Constructors</li>
            </p>
            </code>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>No argument Constructors</h5>
        <p>As the name specifies the no argument constructors of Java does not accept any parameters instead, using these constructors the instance variables of a will be initialized with fixed values for all objects.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>Parameterized Constructors</h5>
        <p>Most often, you will need a constructor that accepts one or more parameters. Parameters are added to a constructor in the same way that they are added to a method, just declare them inside the parentheses after the constructor's name.</p>

    <section class='main-section' id='Basic_Operators'>
      <header>Basic Operators</header>
      <article>
        <p>Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups −</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
            <li>Relational Operators</li>
            <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
            <li>Logical Operators</li>
            <li>Assignment Operators</li>
            <li>Misc Operators</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='Loops'>
    <header>Loops</header>
      <article>
        <p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>
<p>
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages</p>

      <article>
        <p>
        <h5>Enhanced for loop in Java</h5>
As of Java 5, the enhanced for loop was introduced. This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.</p>
<p>
Following is the syntax of enhanced for loop −
  <code>
    for(declaration : expression) {
      // Statements
    }    
  </code>
  Example:
  <code>
    public class Test {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
        int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

        for(int x : numbers ) {
           System.out.print( x );
           System.out.print(",");
        }
        System.out.print("\n");
        String [] names = {"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};

        for( String name : names ) {
           System.out.print( name );
           System.out.print(",");
        }
     }
}
  </code>
  This will produce the following result −

  <code>
    10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
    James, Larry, Tom, Lacy,
  </code>
