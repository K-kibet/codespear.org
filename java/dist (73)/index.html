        <p>Multi-tiered, reliable, and secure enterprise applications that are portable and scalable and that integrate easily with legacy applications and data.</p>

        <p>Some ARM-based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM. </p>

      <header>Automatic memory management</header>
      <article>
        <p>Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use.</p>
        <p>
          Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector.</p>
        <p>Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use.</p>
        <p>If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown.</p>
        <code> class Main {

          public static void main(String[] args) {

          System.out.println("Enter two numbers");
          int first = 10;
          int second = 20;

          System.out.println(first + " " + second);

          // add two numbers
          int sum = first + second;
          System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
          }
          } </code>
