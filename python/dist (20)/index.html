<p> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p> 
<p>Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

<h1>What is Python ?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Python is a backend programming language that’s great for beginners.</li>
  <li>Python is similar in many ways to Ruby, but is less verbose than other programming languages - a little less wordy.</li>
  <li>Python is approachable. Even if you haven’t taken a CS class, you can still write a useful tool in Python. It’s high-level, so you don’t have to deal with the lower-level aspects of programming, such as memory management.</li>
  <li>Python can be used for scripting, web scraping, and creating data sets. It’s popular in the scientific community for scientific computing; there are libraries that make it easy to share academic code projects in Python.</li>
  <li>Python is a web programming language, so it interfaces with the internet. It knows how to receive and send web requests and talk to databases.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h1>Origins of Python</h1>
<p>In the mid-1980s a dutch fellow named Guido van Rossum was working on an educational project to build a language for new coders called ABC. As a result of working on this project, Van Rossum became interested in language design, and that’s when he started working on Python. He made some unusual decisions, which really set Python apart from the zeitgeist at that time, and continue to make the language special today.</p>
<strong>Indentation in Python</strong>
<p>One of Van Rossum’s decisions was to make indentation meaningful, which is unusual in programming languages. Critics who thought this would make the language hard to use didn’t receive the idea very well, but this feature is part of the reason why Python is both readable and popular. Good code style and readability is enforced by the way you have to write Python. When I first learned about indentation in Python, it struck me as a reason for the language’s success.</p>
<strong>Encouraging responsible coding</strong>
<p>A lot of Python’s design is about encouraging developers to make good decisions, so that Python code is more readable. Although indentation is enforced in Python, a lot of other things are not enforced, so you have to be a responsible coder to actually write good Python. Unlike Java, Python doesn’t yell at you if you call a variable or function a particular name, and it doesn’t require you to define a type.</p>
<p>People often describe Java as a really controlling parent, who actively prevents you from playing in the road and forcing you to stay in the house. Even though JavaScript has come a long way, it could be said that JavaScript, is the parent who is actively encouraging you to make bad choices and play in the road. Python is somewhere in the middle: the parent who says you could go play in the road, but should you? They’ll let you do it, but it’s your decision, and you have to deal with the consequences. So Python is somewhat of a, happy medium.</p>

<h1>What are alternatives to Python?</h1>
<p>Python is slower than other languages. There is a trade off between how high-level and abstract a programming language, is and how efficient it is in terms of memory usage and space usage. Python is not low-level, so it’s not as fast or efficient as a compiled, lower-level language, like Java or Rust. It’s less common to use Python to build distributed database systems or other systems where speed is incredibly important.</p>
<p>There are also some concerns about scalability, although I know that you can make Python scalable with different implementations of the language, such as PyPy.</p>
<br>
<h1>Reasons why you should use Python</h1>
<h3>1) Readable and Maintainable Code</h3>
<p>While writing a software application, you must focus on the quality of its source code to simplify maintenance and updates. The syntax rules of Python allow you to express concepts without writing additional code. At the same time, Python, unlike other programming languages, emphasizes on code readability, and allows you to use English keywords instead of punctuations. Hence, you can use Python to build custom applications without writing additional code. The readable and clean code base will help you to maintain and update the software without putting extra time and effort.</p>

<h3>2) Multiple Programming Paradigms</h3>
<p>Like other modern programming languages, Python also supports several programming paradigm. It supports object oriented and structured programming fully. Also, its language features support various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. At the same time, Python also features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. The programming paradigms and language features help you to use Python for developing large and complex software applications.</p>

<h3>3) Compatible with Major Platforms and Systems</h3>
<p>At present, Python is supports many operating systems. You can even use Python interpreters to run the code on specific platforms and tools. Also, Python is an interpreted programming language. It allows you to you to run the same code on multiple platforms without recompilation. Hence, you are not required to recompile the code after making any alteration. You can run the modified application code without recompiling and check the impact of changes made to the code immediately. The feature makes it easier for you to make changes to the code without increasing development time.</p>

<h3>4) Many Open Source Frameworks and Tools</h3>
<p>As an open source programming language, Python helps you to curtail software development cost significantly. You can even use several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools to curtail development time without increasing development cost. You even have option to choose from a wide range of open source Python frameworks and development tools according to your precise needs. For instance, you can simplify and speedup web application development by using robust Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid, Bottle and Cherrypy. Likewise, you can accelerate desktop GUI application development using Python GUI frameworks and toolkits like PyQT, PyJs, PyGUI, Kivy, PyGTK and WxPython.</p>

<h3>5) Simplify Complex Software Development</h3>
<p>Python is a general purpose programming language. Hence, you can use the programming language for developing both desktop and web applications. Also, you can use Python for developing complex scientific and numeric applications. Python is designed with features to facilitate data analysis and visualization. You can take advantage of the data analysis features of Python to create custom big data solutions without putting extra time and effort. At the same time, the data visualization libraries and APIs provided by Python help you to visualize and present data in a more appealing and effective way. Many Python developers even use Python to accomplish artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks.</p>

<h3>6) Adopt Test Driven Development</h3>
<p>You can use Python to create prototype of the software application rapidly. Also, you can build the software application directly from the prototype simply by refactoring the Python code. Python even makes it easier for you to perform coding and testing simultaneously by adopting test driven development (TDD) approach. You can easily write the required tests before writing code and use the tests to assess the application code continuously. The tests can also be used for checking if the application meets predefined requirements based on its source code.</p>

<>However, Python, like other programming languages, has its own shortcomings. It lacks some of the built-in features provided by other modern programming language. Hence, you have to use Python libraries, modules, and frameworks to accelerate custom software development. Also, several studies have shown that Python is slower than several widely used programming languages including Java and C++. You have to speed up the Python application by making changes to the application code or using custom runtime. But you can always use Python to speed up software development and simplify software maintenance.</p>

<h1>What kind of jobs can you get with Python?</h1>
<strong>Web Development</strong>
<p>At Hackbright Academy, we focus more on back-end web development, so we see most of our grads getting standard web development roles like Software Engineers, Web Developers, and Front-End Web Developers, working in Python or in other languages. The protocols, tasks, and the workflow you learn when you become a web developer will be a good foot in the door for technology jobs. We see a lot of grads going into web development first, then if they do eventually want to work in data science or scientific computing, then they can shift over once they’ve learned all of the core principles.</p>

<strong>Data Science</strong>
<p>A couple of Hackbright grads have gone into Data Analytics or Data Science. Maybe they worked on a dev team or as a business analyst before attending Hackbright Academy, so they already had some general experience, but they needed to know Python in order to specialize. Python is the language if you want to go into machine learning or data science, and it has an excellent set of libraries for that type of work.</p>
