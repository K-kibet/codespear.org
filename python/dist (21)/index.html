            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.</li>
                    
                    <li>Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.</li>
                    
                    <li>Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.</li>
                    
                     <li> Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</li>
                    
                    <li>We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.</li>
                    
                    <li>Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</li>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from the other programming languages. It supports object-oriented programming, procedural programming approaches and provides dynamic memory allocation. We have listed below a few essential features.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.</li>

                <li>Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple line</li>

                <li>Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.</li>

                <li>Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once.</li>

                <li>Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org. It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards make new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny."</li>

                <li>Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.</li>

                <li>It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code.</li>

                <li>It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.</li>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>

                <p> <b>Let's dig deeper-</b><br>
                    In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application based work in December of 1989 by at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in Netherland. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had the interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did as really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language which had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.
                    The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions.</p>
                   <p>
                       <b>Why the name Python?</b><br>
                       There is a fact behind choosing the name Python. Guido van Rossum was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". It was late on-air 1970s.<br>

                        Van Rossum wanted to select a name which unique, sort, and little-bit mysterious. So he decided to select naming Python after the "Monty Python's Flying Circus" for their newly created programming language.<br>

                        The comedy series was creative and well random. It talks about everything. Thus it is slow and unpredictable, which made it very interesting.<br>

                <h2>Python applications</h2>
                <p>Python is known for its general-purpose nature that makes it applicable in almost every domain of software development. Python makes its presence in every emerging field. It is the fastest-growing programming language and can develop any application</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><u>Web applications</u></li>
                    We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser, etc. One of Python web-framework named Django is used on Instagram. Python provides many useful frameworks, and these are given below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Django and Pyramid framework(Use for heavy applications)</li>
                        <li>Flask and Bottle (Micro-framework)</li>
                        <li>Plone and Django CMS (Advance Content management)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Desktop GUI Applications</u></li>
                    The GUI stands for the Graphical User Interface, which provides a smooth interaction to any application. Python provides a Tk GUI library to develop a user interface. Some popular GUI libraries are given below.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kivy (used for writing multitouch applications )</li>
                        <li>wxWidgetM</li>
                        <li>Tkinter or Tk</li>
                        <li>PyQt or Pyside</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    <li><u>Console-based Application</u></li>
                    Console-based applications run from the command-line or shell. These applications are computer program which are used commands to execute. This kind of application was more popular in the old generation of computers. Python can develop this kind of application very effectively. It is famous for having REPL, which means the Read-Eval-Print Loop that makes it the most suitable language for the command-line applications.<br>

                    Python provides many free library or module which helps to build the command-line apps. The necessary IO libraries are used to read and write. It helps to parse argument and create console help text out-of-the-box. There are also advance libraries that can develop independent console apps.<br>
                    <br>

                    <li><u>Software Development</u></li>
                    Python is useful for the software development process. It works as a support language and can be used to build control and management, testing, etc.
                    <ul>
                        <li>SCons is used to build control.</li>
                        <li>Buildbot and Apache Gumps are used for automated continuous compilation and testing</li>
                        <li>Round or Trac for bug tracking and project management.</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    <li><u>Scientific and Numeric</u></li>
                    This is the era of Artificial intelligence where the machine can perform the task the same as the human. Python language is the most suitable language for Artificial intelligence or machine learning. It consists of many scientific and mathematical libraries, which makes easy to solve complex calculations.

                    Implementing machine learning algorithms require complex mathematical calculation. Python has many libraries for scientific and numeric such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. If you have some basic knowledge of Python, you need to import libraries on the top of the code. Few popular frameworks of machine libraries are given below.
                    <ul>
                        <li>SciPy</li>
                        <li>Scikit-learn</li>
                       <li>NumPy</li>
                       <li>Pandas</li>

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>Python provides us the two ways to run a program:
                    <ol>
                   <li>Using Interactive interpreter prompt</li>
                        <p>Python provides us the feature to execute the Python statement one by one at the interactive prompt. It is preferable in the case where we are concerned about the output of each line of our Python program.</p>
                    <li>Using a script file</li>
                    <p>
                        The interpreter prompt is best to run the single-line statements of the code. However, we cannot write the code every-time on the terminal. It is not suitable to write multiple lines of code.
                            <br>
                        Using the script mode, we can write multiple lines code into a file which can be executed later. For this purpose, we need to open an editor like notepad, create a file named and save it with .py extension, which stands for "Python".
                    </p>
                    </ol>
                   <u> Example:</u><br>
                    <b>print ("hello world");</b> 
                 </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "comments">
            <article>
                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>Python Comment is an essential tool for the programmers. Comments are generally used to explain the code. We can easily understand the code if it has a proper explanation. A good programmer must use the comments because in the future anyone wants to modify the code as well as implement the new module; then, it can be done easily.
                    <br>
                In the other programming language such as C++, It provides the // for single-lined comment and /*.... */ for multiple-lined comment, but Python provides the single-lined Python comment. To apply the comment in the code we use the hash(#) at the beginning of the statement or code.</p>

                Let's understand the following example.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single line comment</li>
                <i># This is the print statement  <br>
                    print("Hello Python")  </i>
                 <p>Here we have written comment over the print statement using the hash(#). It will not affect our print statement.</p> 
                 <li>Multiline Python Comment</li>
                 <p>We must use the hash(#) at the beginning of every line of code to apply the multiline Python comment. Consider the following example</p>
                 <i>
                    # First line of the comment  <br> 
                    # Second line of the comment  <br>
                    # Third line of the comment  <br>
                 </i>
                 </ul>
            </article>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "variables">
            <article>
                <h2>Python Variables </h2>
                <p>Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. Python variable is also known as    an identifier and used to hold value.<br>

                    In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language and smart enough to get variable type.<br>
                    
                    Variable names can be a group of both the letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.<br><br>
                    It is recommended to use lowercase letters for the variable name. Rahul and rahul both are two different variables.
                </p>
                <b>Identifier Naming</b><br>
                 Variables are the example of identifiers. An Identifier is used to identify the literals used in the program. The rules to name an identifier are given below.
                 <ul>
                    <li>The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).</li>
                    <li>All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore, or digit (0-9).</li>
                    <li>Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).</li>
                    <li>Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the language.</li>
                    <li>Identifier names are case sensitive; for example, my name, and MyName is not the same.</li>
                    <li>Examples of valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.</li>
                    <li>Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Declaring Variable and Assigning Values</b>
                <p>Python does not bind us to declare a variable before using it in the application. It allows us to create a variable at the required time.

                    We don't need to declare explicitly variable in Python. When we assign any value to the variable, that variable is declared automatically.
                    
                    The equal (=) operator is used to assign value to a variable.</p>
                    <b>Example</b><br>
                    <i>counter = 100          # An integer assignment<br>
                        miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point<br>
                        name    = "John"       # A string</i>

                <h2>Python Datatypes</h2>
                <p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.<br>

                    Python has five standard data types −
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers</li>
                    <li>String</li>
                    <li>List</li>

            <article>
                <h2>Python Casting</h2>
                <b>Specify a Variable Type</b>
                <p>There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.</p>

                Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
                <ul>
                    <li>int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by rounding down to the previous whole number), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)</li>

                <h2>Python Literals</h2>
                <p>Generally, literals are a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. They can also be defined as raw value or data given in variables or constants. </p>
                Python has different types of literals.

                <h2>Python Operators</h2>
                <p>The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands. Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in a specific programming language. Python provides a variety of operators, which are described as follows.</p>

                <h2>Python Function</h2>
                <p>Functions are the most important aspect of an application. A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.<br>

                    Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the Python program.<br>
                    
                    The Function helps to programmer to break the program into the smaller part. It organizes the code very effectively and avoids the repetition of the code. As the program grows, function makes the program more organized.<br>
                    
                    Python provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print(). Although, the user can create its functions, which can be called user-defined functions.</p>

                    There are mainly two types of functions.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>User-define functions</b> - The user-defined functions are those define by the user to perform the specific task.</li>

                        <li><b>Built-in functions -</b>The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in Python.</li>
                    </ul>
                    In this tutorial, we will discuss the user define functions.<br>

                    <strong>Advantage of Functions in Python</strong><br>
                    There are the following advantages of Python functions.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using functions, we can avoid rewriting the same logic/code again and again in a program.</li>
                        <li>We can call Python functions multiple times in a program and anywhere in a program.</li>
                        <li>We can track a large Python program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.</li>
                        <li>Reusability is the main achievement of Python functions.</li>
                        <li>However, Function calling is always overhead in a Python program.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Creating a Function</strong><br>
                    Python provides the def keyword to define the function. The syntax of the define function is given below.<br><br>
                    <i>Syntax:<br>
                        <pre>
                            def my_function(parameters):  
                            function_block  
                            return expression  </pre>
                    </i>
                        Let's understand the syntax of functions definition.
                        <ul>
                        <li>The def keyword, along with the function name is used to define the function.</li>
                        <li>The identifier rule must follow the function name.</li>
                        <li>A function accepts the parameter (argument), and they can be optional.</li>
                        <li>The function block is started with the colon (:), and block statements must be at the same indentation.</li>
                        <li>The return statement is used to return the value. A function can have only one return</li>
                    </ul>

            <article>
                <h2>Python String</h2>
                <p>Till now, we have discussed numbers as the standard data-types in Python. In this section of the tutorial, we will discuss the most popular data type in Python, i.e., string.</p>
                <p>Python string is the collection of the characters surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes. The computer does not understand the characters; internally, it stores manipulated character as the combination of the 0's and 1's.</p>
                <p>Each character is encoded in the ASCII or Unicode character. So we can say that Python strings are also called the collection of Unicode characters.</p>
                <p>In Python, strings can be created by enclosing the character or the sequence of characters in the quotes. Python allows us to use single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes to create the string.</p>
                <p>Consider the following example in Python to create a string.</p>
                <i>Syntax:<br>
                str = "Hi Python !"  </i> 
                <p>Here, if we check the type of the variable str using a Python script</p>
                <i>print(type(str)), then it will print a string (str).    </i>
                <p>In Python, strings are treated as the sequence of characters, which means that Python doesn't support the character data-type; instead, a single character written as 'p' is treated as the string of length 1.</p>
               
            </article>

        <section class = "main-section" id ="Python_Modules">
            <article>
                <h2>Python Modules</h2>
                <p>A python module can be defined as a python program file which contains a python code including python functions, class, or variables. In other words, we can say that our python code file saved with the extension (.py) is treated as the module. We may have a runnable code inside the python module. </p>
                <p>Modules in Python provides us the flexibility to organize the code in a logical way.</p>
                <p>To use the functionality of one module into another, we must have to import the specific module.</p>
                <b>Example</b>
                <p>In this example, we will create a module named as file.py which contains a function func that contains a code to print some message on the console. </p>
                <p>Let's create the module named as <strong>file.py.</strong></p>
                <i>
                    <pre>
                        #displayMsg prints a message to the name being passed.   
                        def displayMsg(name)  
                            print("Hi "+name);    
                    </pre>
                </i>
                <p>Here, we need to include this module into our main module to call the method displayMsg() defined in the module named file.</p>
