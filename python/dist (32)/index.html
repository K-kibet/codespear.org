    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        web development (server-side),
      </li>
      <li>software development,</li>
      <li>mathematics,</li>
      <li>system scripting.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>

  <header>What can Python do ?</header>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
  </li>
  <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
</li>
  <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
</li>
  <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
  <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="main-section" id="Why_Python_?">
  <header>Why Python ?</header>
   <ul>
    <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc)
</li>
    <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
    <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
    <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
    <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</li>
  </ul>

  <header>Python Install</header>
  <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>
  <code class="install">
    <span> C:\Users\Your Name>python --version></span>
  </code>
  <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:</p>
</section>
  <code class="install">
    python --version
  </code>
  <p>If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">  https://www.python.org/</a> </p>

<section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
  <header>Syntax</header>
  <p>Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
  <code class="install"> >>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!</code>
 <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</p>
  <code class="install">C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py</code>
  
</section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
  <header>Variables</header>
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

      A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
    <code class="install">x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
      print(y)</code>
    <h3> Result </h3>
    <code class="code" >
    5
      <br>
John
    </code>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
